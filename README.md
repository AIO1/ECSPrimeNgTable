# PrimeNG Table reusable component
A solution that shows how to use a PrimeNG table with advace filters delegating all logic to the database engine. This solution is designed to use Angular for the frontend and a .NET API (ASP.NET) for the backend. As database engine Microsoft SQL Server has been used, but other database engines should work with small modifications in the code.

## 1 Required software
To run this example, the following software is needed and needs to be setup:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download): Used for development in the frontend.
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/): Used for development in the backend API of ASP.NET Core.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager): For being able to run in development the Angular application. It is strongly recomended that you manage your Node.js with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads): The database engine that will store all the data and perform all the query operations. This actually is optional since with a few modifications in the code, it should with other database engines, but if this is your first time, it is strongly recomended that you use Microsoft SQL Server.
- (Optional) [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/): Used for being able to manage the databases with a virtual interface. Works with a wide variety of database engines. Other database management softwares should work, but this is the one I normally use.
